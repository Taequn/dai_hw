\item Consider  data originally from a study of the nesting horseshoe crabs 
\citep{Brockmann96}. Each female crab in the study had a male crab attached to 
her in her nest. The study investigated factors that affect whether the female 
crab had any other males, called satellites, residing nearby her. Explanatory 
variables thought possibly to affect this included the female crab's color, 
spine condition, weight, and carapace width. The response outcome for each 
female crab is her number of satellites.
	 The sample is
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|ccccccccccccccccc|}\hline
		 Number of Satellites& 0 & 1&  2&  3&  4&  5&  6&  7&  8&  9& 10& 11& 12& 13 &14& 15\\ \hline
		 Number of Observations&62& 16&  9& 19& 19& 15& 13&  4&  6&  3&  3&  1&  1&  1&  1&1\\\hline
 		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
 	It is believed that the distribution of the number of satellites for a female 
 	crab is distributed Poisson$(\lambda)$ where the parameter $\lambda$ is of interest.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the method of moments estimator for $\lambda$.\\
	\textbf{Solution:} We'll be using a nleqslv package \cite{nlesqlv} to solve a non-linear equation to find $\lambda$! Hopefully, you're excited!

        fn = momfunc,
        data=crab.dat$x)
	
	paste("Lambda is ~", answer$x, sep="")
	@
	\item Find the maximum likelihood estimator for $\lambda$.\\
	\textbf{Solution:} For this, we'll use a \texttt{dpois()} function from the base R package and \texttt{optim()} function to find MLE for our Poisson distribution.
	<<>>=
	LLfunc <- function(par, data){
	  answer <- sum(dpois(x=data, lambda = par, log=T))

      fn = LLfunc,

      lower = 0,

	So $\lambda$ is 2.97! It will help us when plotting the data with fitted Poisson distribution over it!

	How well does the distribution fit the data?

\end{center}
\end{figure}
As you might notice, our model doesn't really fit the data that neatly â€” it doesn't take into account the number of zeros that we have in our dataset. This leads the distribution to either underestimate or overestimate values!

	\item Let's try another distribution - the zero-inflated Poisson distribution. 
	Now, it is believed that the distribution of the number of satellites for a 
	female crab is distributed Poisson$_0(\lambda,\sigma)$ where the parameters 
	$\lambda$ and $\sigma$ are of interest. Find the method of moments estimators 
	for both $\sigma$ and $\lambda$.
	 \[f_X(x|\lambda,\sigma)=(1-\sigma)\frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}I(x\geq1) 
	 + (\sigma+(1-\sigma)e^{-\lambda}) I(x=0)\]
	 \textbf{Hint:} Noticing that this is a function of the Poisson PMF and
	 rewriting it will help remarkably.\\
	 \textbf{Solution:} Let's use our favorite nleqslv package \cite{nlesqlv} to calculate the parameters that we are looking for for our zero-inflated Poisson model. We need to find $\lambda$ and $\sigma$!\\
	 When calculating E(X) for ZIP, I noticed that the only difference between the regular Poisson distribution and this one is an additional $(1-\sigma)$, so I assumed that E(X)=$(1-\sigma)\lambda$. While I managed to calculate it, I struggle with Var(X), so I found \cite{b_minerb} discussion on StackOverflow really helpful for my calculations!
<<>>=
zip.pois <- function(par, data){
  lambda <- par[1]
  pi <- par[2]
  
  #Applying my knowledge
  EX1 <- (1-pi)*lambda 
  EX2 <- (1-pi)*(lambda^2+lambda)
  
  xbar1 <- mean(data)
  xbar2 <- mean(data^2)
  
  c(EX1-xbar1, EX2-xbar2)

        data = crab.dat$x)

It's impossible to assess how accurate we are in our calculations without graphing the results. I am going to use \texttt{dzipois()} from VGAM package \cite{VGAM}.

It would seem MOM inflates zero values a bit too much and underestimates the other values. I would suggest that doing MLE would be a superior way of calculating parameters! Let's see if I am correct about it.

	 \item Find the maximum likelihood estimator for $\lambda$ and $\sigma$.\\
	 \textbf{Solution:}
	<<>>=
#MLE
dpois.ll<-function(par, data){
  lambda <- par[1]
  pi <- par[2]
  ll <- sum(dzipois(x=data, lambda=lambda, pstr0=pi, log=T))
  -ll
}
answerZIPll<-optim(par = c(1,0),
      fn = dpois.ll,
      data=crab.dat$x)
paste("Lambda:",answerZIPll$par[1],"Sigma:",answerZIPll$par[2])
  @
	\item Plot a histogram of the data with the zero-inflated Poisson distribution
	fit with the MLE estimates. How well does the distribution fit the data?\\
	\textbf{Solution:} Now, let's assess if we were right about the ultimate superiority of MLE compared to MOM. Yet again, we're going to use VGAM package \cite{VGAM} to create a true density function.
	<<>>=
crab.dat.zim <- crab.dat %>%
	  mutate(f = dzipois(x=x, lambda=4.5770923, pstr0=0.3496381))

ggplot(crab.dat.zim, aes(x=x))+
	  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), fill="deepskyblue2", color="black", 
	                 binwidth=1)+
	  geom_linerange(aes(ymin=0, ymax=f), color="dark red")+
	  scale_x_continuous("Number of satellites", 
	                     labels = as.character(sats), breaks = sats)+
	  labs(y="Density",

	       subtitle="ZIP distribution. Lambda=4.5770923, sigma=0.3496381") +
  theme_bw()+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)
@
Now, that's definitely something to write home about! While I don't really like that this model undervalues some values (look at 1, for example), but it does really well when it comes to zero and most other values! \\
\textbf{Case closed:} MLE is superior!

%%%%%%%%%  Question 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item The time to death for rats injected with a toxic substance, denoted by $Y$
	(measured in days), follows an exponential distribution with $\lambda = 1/5$. That is,
	\[Y \sim \textrm{exponential}(\lambda = 1/5).\]
	This is the population distribution. It describes the time to death for all individual rats in the population.

  The \textbf{exponential distribution} serves as a very good model for measurements like waiting times or lifetimes.

  F_X(x|\mu,\sigma) &= \left(1- e^{-\lambda x}\right)I(x \in \mathbb{R^+}\tag*{\textbf{[CDF]}}\\
  F_X^{-1}(p|\mu,\sigma) &= \frac{-\ln(1-p)}{\lambda} \tag*{\textbf{[Inverse CDF]}}\\

	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item Plot the exponential$(\lambda = 1/5)$ population distribution.\\

	  \item Mathematical statisticians can show the exact sampling distributions 
	  of $\bar{Y}$ are gamma; i.e.,
	  \[\bar{Y} \sim \textrm{gamma}(\alpha=n,\beta=\frac{1}{n\lambda}).\]
	  The gamma distribution is described below.
\begin{align*}
\alpha &> 0, \beta>0 \tag*{\textbf{[Parameters]}}\\

\texttt{dgamma(x=x,shape=alpha,scale=beta)}.
Plot the exact sampling distribution for $n=2$, $n=10$, $n=35$, and

\textbf{Solution:} Now, in order to plot our gamme distribution, we need to use \texttt{dgamma()} function within the base R package! Let's see how the graphs are going to vary based on the changes to $n$!

It seems to me that the bigger $n$ gets, the more normal gamma distribution becomes (yet another proof that CLT is correct!). To prove that I am correct, I am going to superimpose a normal distribution function.
	  \item The Central Limit Theorem says that as $n$ increases, the sampling 
	  distribution of $\bar{Y}$ can be well approximated with a Gaussian 
	  distribution. Superimpose the approximate sampling distribution of $\bar{Y}$
	  for $n=2$, $n=10$, $n=35$, and $n=50$.\\
\textbf{Solution:} So in order to apply CLT here, we need to keep in mind that $\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu_{x}$ and $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=sqrt(var(\bar{X}))$. Let's apply it when plotting!

@
We can see that the probability is far off. The explanation is simple: here, we are using only two rats (so $n=2$), and one of CLT assumptions is that $n>30$. So no wonder that the result is off! 
\item Under what conditions would the approximate probability calculated in 
part (f) better match the exact probability in part (e)?\\
\textbf{Solution:} According to the CLT, the bigger the $n$, the closer our AG distribution will get to the actual distribution.

Finally, I am going to put our value on X-axis and assess how far away it is from the rejection region (keep in mind the p-value â€” we already have in mind enough evidence to reject null hypothesis).

      \item Report a 95\% confidence interval for the average BECK depression score

\item Is there a significant difference in the length of stay in treatment by 
    treatment site?\\
\textbf{Solution:} First, let's establish our hypothesis.
\begin{align*}
H_{0}&:\mu_{0}-\mu{1}=0\\
H_{a}&:\mu_{0}-\mu{1}\neq0
\end{align*}

res <- t.test(uis$LEN.T ~ uis$SITE, 
              data = uis, var.equal = F)
paste("P-value:",res$p.value)
@
Based on this two-sample t-test, we have enough evidence to suggest that (with 95\% confidence) our true mean is not equal to 0! Therefore, we have statistically significant results showing that there's a difference in the length of stay between two sites!

%%%%%%%%%  Question 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Below you will load and summarize a dataset containing 53 observations of prostate cance patients.
In this research, a number of possible predictor variables were measured before surgery. The patients then 
had surgery to determine nodal involvement. 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item r -- Nodal Involvement (0=No, 1=Yes)
    \item aged	-- Age Group (0=Less than 60, 1=At least 60)
    \item stage -- Palpitation Result Severity (0=Less severe, 1=More severe)
    \item grade -- Biopsy Result Severity (0=Less severe, 1=More severe)
    \item xray -- X-ray Result Severity (0=Less severe, 1=More severe)
    \item acid -- the level of acid phosphatase in the blood serum
\end{itemize}
The treatment strategy for a patient diagnosed with cancer of the prostate depend highly on whether the cancer has spread to the surrounding lymph nodes (nodal involvement). It is common to operate on the patient to get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a microscope.

\begin{enumerate} %this begins a lettered enumerate so I can ask more 
%than one question in a question.
\item Load the data provided in the ``boot" package for \texttt{R} \citep{boot}.
<<warning=FALSE,message=FALSE>>=
library("boot")
data("nodal")
@
\item Is there evidence that less than half of prostate cancer patients have nodal involvment?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the null hypothesis for this test?\\
      \textbf{Solution:}  $H_{0}: \hat{P}=0.5$
      \item What is the alternative hypothesis for this test?\\
      \textbf{Solution:}  $H_{0}: \hat{P}<0.5$
      \item What is the sample proportion of patients with nodal involvement for these data?\\
      \textbf{Solution:} It's 37\%!
<<>>=
table(nodal$r)[2]/nrow(nodal) #37%
@
      \item What is the test statistics for this test?\\
      \textbf{Solution:} We are working with proportions, so we are going to use a Z-value.
      \item At what value of $\hat{P}$ does the rejection region start for $\alpha=0.05$?\\
      \textbf{Solution:}
      \begin{align*}
      z &= \frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0}(1-p_{0})}{n}}}\\
      \hat{p} &= \frac{\sqrt{n}z\sqrt{p_{0}(1-p_{0})}}{n} + p_{0}
      \end{align*}
      
<<>>=
p0 <- 0.5
phat <- table(nodal$r)[2]/nrow(nodal)
n <- nrow(nodal)
z1 <- qnorm(.05, 0, 1)

answerProp<-(sqrt(n)*z1*sqrt(p0*(1-p0)))/(n) + p0

paste("Rejection starts with", answerProp, "but we already have a lower number:",
      table(nodal$r)[2]/nrow(nodal))
@
Having a number lower than the rejection region is the first sign that true $\hat{P}$ is not 0.5!
      \item What is the p value for this test?
<<>>=
answerPropTest <- prop.test(20, 53, p=0.5, alternative="less")
paste("P-value:",answerPropTest$p.value)
@
We have enough evidence to reject null hypothesis in favor of the alternative!
      \item Graph the results of this test.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
<<>>=
ggdat <- data.frame(t=seq(-5,5,length=500))%>%
  mutate(f=dnorm(x=t, mean=0, sd=1))

It's one of those times when it's really hard to tell by the graph alone if the dot within the rejection region or outside of it. So, as I've done before, we can use \texttt{prop.test()} in order to check the p-value!
      \item Report a 95\% confidence interval for the proportion of prostate cancer patients with nodal involvement and interpret it in the context of this question.
<<>>=
propCI<-prop.test(20, 53, alternative="two.sided")
paste("Confidence interval is", propCI$conf.int)
@
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Clearly, it would be preferable if an accurate assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery. Is there a significant difference in the nodal involvement of patients with any of the severity indicators?\\
    \textbf{Solution:}\\
    $H_{0}:\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}=0$\\
    $H_{0}:\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\neq0$
<<>>=
#H0: p1-p2 = 0
#Ha: p1-p2 != 0
nodal.c <- nodal %>%
  mutate(sev = case_when(stage==1 ~ 1,
                         grade==1 ~ 1,
                         xray==1 ~ 1,
                         TRUE ~ 0)) #put all severity indicators into one
#non severe
x1<-1
n1<-16
#Non severe: 1 involvement out of 16 cases

#severe
x2<-19
n2<-37
#Severe: 19 involvements out of 37 cases

finalProp <- prop.test(x=c(x1,x2),
          n=c(n1,n2))
paste("P-value of two-sample test is", finalProp$p.value)
@
Based on the p-value, we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of alternative. Therefore, there's actually a significant in the nodal involvement in patients with severity indicators.

\noindent \textbf{Bonus 2:} Compare the effectiveness of the $t$-interval with the bootstrap interval. In a loop, generate 1000 datasets, evaluate a $t$ and bootstrapping confidence interval for each set of data, and track whether you've captured the true population mean. An effective answer here would evaluate this several times varying sample size and the data generating distribution.
